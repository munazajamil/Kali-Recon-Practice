- Passive Reconnaissance Tools

This folder contains my hands-on practice using **Passive Reconnaissance tools** in Kali Linux as part of my cybersecurity learning journey.



-  What is Passive Recon?

Passive reconnaissance is the process of collecting information about a target **without directly interacting with the target system**. This means gathering publicly available data through open-source methods ‚Äî making it stealthy and less detectable.


- Tools Used in This Folder:

| Tool         | Purpose                                           |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Whois        | Domain registration and owner lookup              |
| Nslookup     | DNS records gathering                             |
| TheHarvester | Collect emails, hosts, subdomains from OSINT      |
| Spiderfoot   | Automated OSINT tool to gather domain info        |
| Google Dorks | Advanced Google search queries for info gathering |


 
 - What's Included:

Each tool has a dedicated `.md` file where I documented:
- What the tool does
- Exact command(s) I used
- Screenshots of results/output
- Key takeaways and notes

Explore them to see how I gathered intelligence from p ublicly available sources.

-  Use Case

These tools help ethical hackers or security analysts learn about the target environment without touching the system, making it useful for initial assessments and passive OSINT investigations.



-  Learning Outcome

From passive recon, I learned to:
- Use open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools effectively
- Gather target information quietly
- Build a profile of the target using only publicly available data
