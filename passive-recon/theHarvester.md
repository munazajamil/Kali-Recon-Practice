Collect emails, subdomains, hosts, employee names from public sources.

Found no hostnames associated with the domains
I found no such data but this is way how to use, this happened because i target a publically availble test website.

This tool helped identify public facing assets of the target without directly interacting with their server. 
It's useful in early stages of recon.
