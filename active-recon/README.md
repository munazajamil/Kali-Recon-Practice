-  Active Reconnaissance Tools

This folder contains my practical work using Active Reconnaissance tools on Kali Linux.



-  What is Active Recon?

Active reconnaissance involves directly interacting with the target system to gather detailed information. These scans can be detected by the target, so they are typically used in controlled environments or during authorized penetration testing.



üß∞ Tools Used in This Folder:

| Tool      | Purpose                                           |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Nmap      | Network and port scanning                         |
| Nikto     | Web server vulnerability scanning                 |
| Gobuster  | Directory and file brute-forcing on web servers   |
| WhatWeb   | Web technology fingerprinting                     |
| Dirb      | Discover hidden web directories and files         |



-  What's Included:

Each tool has its own `.md` file explaining:
- Purpose of the tool
- Exact command(s) used
- Summary of scan results
- Screenshot of terminal output
- Personal notes and takeaways

You can explore these files to see the real commands I ran, the output I received, and what I learned from each.


-  Use Case

These tools were used to simulate what an ethical hacker would do during the early stages of a penetration test, especially when identifying entry points, vulnerabilities, and system configurations that are exposed to the internet.

 
 - Learning Outcome

Active Recon gave me hands-on experience with:
- Understanding how attackers identify live services and vulnerabilities
- Differentiating between stealthy (passive) and aggressive (active) methods
- Using ethical hacking tools responsibly in test environments
