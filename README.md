Kali Linux Reconnaissance Practice

This project showcases my practical learning of "Passive" and "Active" Reconnaissance techniques using real tools in Kali Linux.

I documented every step of my information gathering process, using both passive and active recon tools, and included real commands, screenshots, and outputs. This portfolio is part of my journey to becoming a Cybersecurity Expert.

|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `/passive-tools/`  | Tools used for passive reconnaissance (e.g., theHarvester, SpiderFoot) |
| `/active-recon-tools/` | Tools used for active scanning (e.g., Nmap, Nikto, Gobuster) |
| `/screenshots/`    | Terminal output and scan results in PNG format  |
